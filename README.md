## Reinforcement Learning / Imitation Resources for Unitree H12

Below is a curated list of open-source repositories related to **reinforcement learning (RL)**, **simulation**, and **control** for the Unitree H12 (also known as H1-2).

---

### 1. [Unitree RL Lab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_lab)
An official **Unitree Robotics** project providing RL environments and infrastructure for Unitree robots, built on IsaacLab.  
Supports robots such as **Go2**, **H1**, and **G1** â€” and can be extended to **H12**.

---

### 2. [Unitree RL Gym](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_gym)
Implements RL for Unitree robots using **Gym**, **Isaac Gym**, and **MuJoCo**.  
Includes training pipelines for humanoid robots such as **H1**, **H1-2**, and **G1**.

---

### 3. [Unitree Sim IsaacLab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sim_isaaclab)
Provides **simulation tasks and environments** for Unitree robots using IsaacLab.  
Contains humanoid-related scenarios such as:
- `Isaac-PickPlace-RedBlock-H12-27dof`
- Other task definitions relevant to H12 locomotion and manipulation.

---

### 4. [Unitree IL LeRobot](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_IL_lerobot)
Built on **LeRobot**, an open-source embodied learning framework.  
Focuses on **imitation learning** and **data-driven skill learning**

---
### 5. [IsaacLab Locomotion H1-2](https://github.com/NirajPudasaini/IsaacLab_Locomotion_H1-2) [INCOMPLETE]
A standalone extension of **IsaacLab** tailored for Unitree H12 locomotion.  
Focuses on adapting environments, robot configurations, and training tasks for flat and rough terrain locomotion.
